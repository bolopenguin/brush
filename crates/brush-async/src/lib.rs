//! Pinned single-threaded async executors that hide the native/wasm
//! split behind one API.
//!
//! Brush's GPU layer (cubecl/burn-fusion) keys ordering on the current
//! OS thread (`StreamId::current()` is thread-local). tokio's
//! work-stealing scheduler moves async tasks across threads at every
//! `.await`, so a single logical render that issues GPU work before
//! and after an await ends up registering ops against two different
//! `StreamId`s. The resulting cross-stream dispatch produces visible
//! corruption (duplicate IDs, NaNs, stale buffers) even when the
//! underlying handle bookkeeping stays consistent.
//!
//! [`Actor`] sidesteps that: it owns one OS thread (native) or runs
//! against one JS event loop (wasm) and pins every future it executes
//! to that single context. Futures spawned on an `Actor` therefore do
//! NOT need to be `Send`, and `StreamId::current()` is invariant for
//! their entire lifetime.
